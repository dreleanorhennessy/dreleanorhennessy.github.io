I am curently a postdoctoral scholar in the School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment at Arizona State University, where I do research at the intersection of energy systems, decarbonization, and environmental justice. I received a PhD in Energy Resource Engineering in 2022 from Stanford University, a MS in Civil and Environmental Engineering in 2017 from Stanford University, and a BS in Civil and Environmental Engineering in 2015 from Rice University. I have worked as a summer fellow at the City of Palo Alto Utilities and the United Nations Foundation, and as a research analyst at the Center for Sustainable Energy. In my free time you'll find me hiking in the mountains or searching for good light to photograph.
